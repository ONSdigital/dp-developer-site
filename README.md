dp-developer-site
================

:warning: Work in progress :warning:

A Go application that generates the HTML pages for the developer site for ons.gov.uk. 

Should be available soon at [developer.ons.gov.uk](https://developer.ons.gov.uk).

### Getting started

To run this app you'll need [Golang](https://golang.org/) installed and setup. Then run:

```
make
```

#### Development

The templates that make up the developer site are available in `/templates`.

Static pages, such as the introduction are in `/static`.

To watch and automatically rebuild the site on any changes to any `.go`, `.md` or `.tmpl` file run:
```
make watch
```

To only serve the built assets (on default port of `23600`) run:
```
make serve
```

...which has an optional `PORT` environment variable, for example:
```
make server PORT=8000
```

Or to watch the files for changes and host them run:
```
make watch-serve
```


### Configuration
