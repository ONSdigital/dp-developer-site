# dp-developer-site

A Go application that generates the HTML pages for the developer hub for ons.gov.uk.

Available at [developer.ons.gov.uk](https://developer.ons.gov.uk).

## Getting started

To run this app you'll need certain versions installed:

| Language | version   |
|----------|-----------|
| Go       | >= 1.21.1 |
| Node     | = 14.21.3 |
| Python   | >= 3.9.2  |

These versions are what the pipeline will build with.

## Development

The templates that make up the developer hub are available in `/templates`.

Static pages, such as the introduction are in `/static`.

The most common use case will be to update files and watch them change on the local site:

to watch the files for changes and host them run:

```bash
make watch-serve
```

or, with a custom port:

```bash
make watch-serve PORT=8000
```

### Other notable commands are as follows

To watch and automatically rebuild the site on any changes to any `.go`, `.md` or `.tmpl` file run:

```bash
make watch
```

To only serve the built assets (on default port of `23600`) run:

```bash
make serve
```

...which has an optional `PORT` environment variable, for example:

```bash
make server PORT=8000
```

### Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description                    |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| PORT                 | 23600   | The port to serve the files on |
