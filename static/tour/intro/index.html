<p>The Office for National Statistics API makes datasets and other data available
programmatically using HTTP.</p>

<p>The API is available at <tt>https://api.beta.ons.gov.uk/v1</tt></p>

<p>It also allows you to filter datasets and directly access specific data points.</p>

<p>The API is open and unrestricted - no API keys are required, so you can start using it immediately.</p>
